# Memory Card

:arrow_forward: **[Live preview!](https://nekosoffy-memory-card.netlify.app/)**

A DOTA 2-inspired memory card game, built with React. The objective is to click on a unique card each round without repeating any selections. With each click, the cards dynamically shuffle, making the game progressively more challenging.

The data for the game is fetched from the OpenDota API, and the card shuffling is handled using the Durstenfeld shuffle algorithm. The game's interactive functionality is powered by React's state management and effect hooks.
